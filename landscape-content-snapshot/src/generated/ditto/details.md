# Ditto 

Resilient Edge Device Connectivity.  Servers and Cloud, Optional.  The only mobile database with built-in edge device connectivity and resiliency

## Keep mission-critical systems online when it matters most

Ditto is the only edge-native, mobile database that can consistently support your business anytime, anywhere. Edge-native solutions are built specifically to thrive on mobile and edge devices, without relying solely on cloud-based services.

- **Build flexible operations** that are both latency-sensitive and resilient without reliance on network hardware, edge servers, or the cloud.
- **Decentralize your systems** to remove single points of failure that lead to operational bottlenecks.
- **Drive consistent revenue and customer service** anywhere, regardless of connectivity or bandwidth.
- **Offline-first mobile database**: Even when your devices are completely offline, they can awlays read, write, and process data.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all major platforms.
- **CRDT-powered conflict resolution**: To resolve concurrency conflicts that appear in decentralized models, as well as enable delta-based sync, Ditto harnesses the power of conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) technology. 

## P2P Sync 

### Automatic Device Discovery and Mesh Networking

Out-of-the-box support for BLE, P2P Wifi, LAN, and more enables real-time sync in disconnected or bandwidth-constrained environments.

### Direct Peer-to-Peer Sync

Out-of-the-box suport for direct peer-to-peer sync between devices, without the need for a central server.

### Opportunistic Cloud Sync 

Anytime internet is available within the mesh, devices sync with your existing cloud systems.

## Core Features

- **Intelligent Rainbow Connection**: Ditto manages multiple P2P and IP-based transports at the same time and optimizes your sync for speed based on available bandwidth.
- **Opportunistic Cloud Sync**: Opportunistically sync with Ditto Server whenever a device within the mesh has internet.
- **Bidirectional Cloud Connector**: Bidirectionally sync from Ditto Server to your existing systems.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Build and sync across your preferred languages, frameworks, and platforms.
- **Conflict Resolution with CRDTs**: Simultaneous and offline changes are automatically resolved
- **Expressive query system**: Find what you need with advanced filters, sorting, transactions.
- **Reactive Design Patterns**: No more polling code for changes, register queries and get updates in real-time.
- **Bring your own authentication**: Whether it's JWT, OAuth 2.0 or SAML. Bring your own identity providers.
